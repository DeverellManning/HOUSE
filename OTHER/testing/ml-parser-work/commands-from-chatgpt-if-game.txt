Greet the elderly person

WHere am I?

Are we underground?

Okay.  I ask the old man, "What's your story?"

I ask the old man: "What is around this area?  Are there any tracks, towns, outposts, or entrances?  What year is it?"

No, thanks.  I hope you have a good time.

By the way, whats your name?

The old man's name is ChatGPT. Got it.

I leave ChatGPT's house.

I travel east.  What time of day is it?

Do I pass near any signs before I get to the village?

I continue traveling to the town.  What else happens?

inventory

So I don't have any money, do I?

I ask someone the way to the town hall.

I walk to the notice board and read it.

I look around for someone I can get answers from.
ChatGPT said:

I walk over to the innkeeper and greet them.  What do they look like?

What gender is the innkeeper?

Okay.  I greet the innkeeper warmly and ask him about the festival.

I reply to him.  "It sounds like it's gonna be a lot of fun.  How is preparation for the festival going?"

I ask the innkeeper, "What does the festival celebrate?"

I tell him "That sounds cool.  I'm looking forward to being there next week."

  I return to the sign.  What job postings are there?

What roads can I take around here?

I walk down Main Street to find the General Store.

I greet the store keeper.

I ask her "What kind of stuff do you stock?"

"That great."  I say.  "Just curious, where do you get these things from?"

"Oh, so do you know this land pretty well?"  I ask her, eager for information.  I'm still confused as to where I am and how I got here.  Maybe I can learn something useful in this town.

I relax somewhat, and ask her about possible part-time employment.  "I realize that I'm penniless."  I chuckle.  "I'm interested in staying here for a little bit, so I'm looking for some work.  I saw the postings on the notice board, so..."

"I'll think about it.  Thanks for talking with me!"

I head to the marketplace on main street.

What's in my inventory?

I mosey up to a business man in a stall, and ask him if this town has a bank.

"No, thank-you.  Be seeing you!"  I set off to find the south road.  On my out, I look up and examine the sky.

Before I enter, I estimate the time of day based on the sun.  I'd like to know if it will be dark soon.

I knock on the door and prepare myself.

"Hi, I'm a traveler new to this area.  I came to inquire about making make a small, short term loan."

I have no money, and am looking to get a job.  I may need a ... uh ... Excuse me, but what money do we use here?  

I continue, slightly confused.  "Okay, so ... How much would I need for a day's lodging and food?"

I maintain my composure, and internally I think about inflation.  I say "Okay.  I'm looking to get a loan of 15 silver pieces to be repaid in a week.  I have some items I could use collateral, if needed."

I present the lantern and silver key on his table.

I thank him.  "Thanks.  Do you keep the collateral in this situation?"

"Okay.  I'm ready to proceed with the loan."

After saying goodbye, I check my inventory before leaving the building.

  I leave the building.

What time of day is it?  Keep track of the time of day as it gets farther into the evening.  I begin to travel north on the south road back to the village.

I continue north, keeping an eye out for anything I might notice.

I head toward the inn once I reach the village.

I greet him.  "I would like to get a room for the night.  What are your rates?"

"Thank you.  I'm not feeling quite hungry yet, but I'd be pleased to be shown to my room."  It's true, I'm not very hungry for some reason.

I check my inventory

How am I carrying the items in my inventory?

I examine the leaflet closely.

That's interesting.  i got it from a mailbox at a house some distance from here, and it's so old and faded ...  I wonder when it was printed.  Anyway, it there a mirror in here?

I look deep into the mirror.  What do I see?

Study the mirror closer.

I stare at the mirror for 5 minutes.

I look at the window.

I lay down on my bed.
