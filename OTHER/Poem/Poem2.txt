The green bedroom is cozy, and unlike the
Blue bedroom, the Green bedroom is not 
COMPLETLY green.  There is a nice wooden bed
with green covers and brown sheets, and curtains 
covering the window, letting in a nice atmosphere
of light.



Rain drizzling on your face
as you come into your self
and you open up your eyes
from your sleep				Slumber

Roll over, you stand and stare		!
and wonder at the fields
fields of memories
all round you.

But the wind flies ahead
to the end of the path
Bringing your eyes, looking
toward the chalkboard

And the chalkboard,			!
You drift over, curious			!
To glean meaning, it's words:
"Next or done"				!

And you’re taking the chalk
And your touching the board
So, the chalk turns to dust
Blows away

And you’re ready, well set
To embark once again
For a chance to try again
You wake up...
