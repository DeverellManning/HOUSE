Light rain dripping on your face	
As you come back to your self	
And you open up your eyes		
from your strange sleep

Up Above, static, grey clouds
Covering the sky and sun
Filling the dreary air with
Soft falling rain

You roll over, stand and stare
And Wonder at the fields
Plains of memories cut short
all around you

But the wind attends you	!
The end of the Gravel path
Bringing your eyes, focusing
On the Chalkboard 		!

The placid Chalkboard, shadowed
The grasses flirt toward it
You drift over curious,
At Bone-white writing thereof	!

So as you come close to it
You stare at the dark chalkboard
To glean meaning, from it's words:
"Again”, and “End"

So you take your stick of chalk
Then you touch it to the board
Then the chalk melts into dust
And blows away

But you’re ready to embark
To obtain your life, again
A second chance for success
So, You wake up...
