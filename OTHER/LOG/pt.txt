  Master Bedroom  
	This bedroom is peaceful and bright, so you start to 
relax.  In the middle of the far wall, there is a double window 
bordered by curtains.  There is a sizable bed under the window, 
which is made up with soft blankets and a brown quilt.  The wall
 opposite the door has wardrobe and a shelf next to each other, 
separated by a stack of boxes.  There is also a fine, cedar 
dresser next to the bed on the wall side.  This room has walls 
painted a yellow-pink color, with classic trim around the door 
and window.  The hardwood floor is covered by a thick carpet the
 length of the room.
